# Web-Application-Security-Header-Assessment
Project Overview:
This project involved scanning a website for missing security headers using two OWASP tools, identifying five missing headers, and explaining the significance of three critical headers. The aim was to assess the website’s security posture and suggest improvements by implementing security headers that enhance web application security, mitigating common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and clickjacking.

Business Understanding:
In a digital environment where web applications are constantly exposed to potential attacks, security headers provide a key layer of defence. By implementing the appropriate security headers, businesses can prevent malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting, MIME-type confusion, and clickjacking. Without these precautions, organizations risk exposing their users to data theft, fraudulent activities, and a loss of trust. This project highlights the importance of security headers in reducing attack vectors, thus improving overall application security and user confidence.

Tools and Frameworks:
•	Security Headers (https://securityheaders.com): A tool used to scan and assess the security headers of a website.
•	Mozilla Observatory (https://observatory.mozilla.org): An OWASP tool that evaluates website security configurations.
•	OWASP Secure Headers Project: Reference framework for understanding security headers and their purpose.
•	Website Tested: hack-yourself-first.com.

Project Description:
Objective: The main task was to evaluate the security headers of the website hack-yourself-first.com and identify missing security headers that could be implemented to improve security.
Steps Taken:
1.	Scanning the Website:
o	Utilized two tools, SecurityHeaders.com and Mozilla Observatory, to scan the target website for security headers.
o	Captured screenshots from both tools for the scan results.
2.	Identification of Missing Headers:
o	Highlighted five missing security headers in each tool, which were:
1.	Content Security Policy (CSP)
2.	X-Content-Type-Options
3.	X-Frame-Options
4.	Referrer-Policy
5.	Permissions-Policy

3.	Explanation of the missing Security Headers:
o	Content Security Policy (CSP):
	Description: CSP mitigates risks of XSS and data injection attacks by restricting the sources from which content such as scripts and images can be loaded.
	Why It Should Be Implemented: It helps reduce the risk of malicious script execution, preventing XSS attacks and reducing unauthorized code injection.
o	X-Content-Type-Options:
	Description: Prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than what is specified. Setting this to nosniff enforces adherence to MIME types.
	Why It Should Be Implemented: Prevents MIME sniffing attacks, ensuring files are interpreted correctly and safely by browsers.
o	X-Frame-Options:
	Description: Controls whether a website can be embedded in iframes, thereby preventing clickjacking attacks.
	Why It Should Be Implemented: Mitigates clickjacking by preventing unauthorized framing of web pages, protecting user interactions.
                  Referrer-Policy:
•	Description: This header controls how much information from the HTTP Referrer header is passed along to other sites. It can be configured to limit or obfuscate the referrer data to protect user privacy.
•	Why It Should Be Implemented: Protects sensitive information by preventing unnecessary referrer data from being exposed to third-party sites. It can prevent leaking private browsing data and sensitive URLs to external servers.
  Permissions-Policy:
•	Description: The Permissions-Policy header controls which web features (like geolocation, camera, microphone, etc.) can be used by a website. It can restrict certain APIs or features based on origin or other conditions.
•	Why It Should Be Implemented: Limiting permissions reduces the risk of abuse by malicious actors. For example, disabling access to the camera or microphone for certain origins can prevent unauthorized use and enhance user privacy.

4.	Conclusion:
o	After completing the scans, I identified critical missing headers that should be implemented for enhanced security. These headers protect the website against attacks such as XSS, MIME type misinterpretation, and clickjacking.
o	The project demonstrated the importance of security headers in mitigating web-based attacks and improving a site's security posture. By implementing the identified security headers, businesses can protect users and maintain the integrity of their web applications.
